# Contributing Guidelines

## Design Goal
We really want our ui components and animations according to our theme.

## Goals
 - Provide some custom and new emojis. 
 - Help user generate their custom emojis
 - Download the emojis in different file formats like eg:[svg, jpg, png and even text format *for supported ones*]
 
Feel free to open a issue or a feature request to our repo ðŸ™Œ.
If you know how to fix one of 'em, We really appreciate it.
You must add your name in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. *if the file does not exist, create one*
